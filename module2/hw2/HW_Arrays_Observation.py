#This file exists for you to try different things,
#understand how they work and get confident with concepts
#before jumping to doing for score homework.
#As i have mentioned during the class, do the following:
#   1.Read the line with single "#" in front -- this is an instruction.
#   2.What you read will tell you what to do .It is either:
#          a)Uncomment(UC) line that starts with "##"(code line)
#          b)Write(WC) simple code by yourself.
#   3.Once you done, comment the created or uncommented line to keep things neat
#I specifically made it to mirror largely what we cover in the class,
#but to give you an opportunity to try things by yourself.
#Good Luck

#WC: create an array "goodies" with values: money, power, glory, dignity, success
goodies = ['money', 'power', 'glory', 'dignity', 'success']

#UC:
##print(goodies)
print(goodies)
#UC: show index of each element
for index,value in enumerate(goodies):
   print(index,value)

#UC: shows first element in the array, remember, counting starts at 0
print(goodies[0])

#UC: that will show you how many elements in the array
print(len(goodies))

#UC:that will be an error because there are 6 elements but numbering goes from 0 to 5
# print(goodies[len(goodies)])

#UC: below on the other hand would work. comment out the above line
print(goodies[len(goodies)-1])

#UC: you can shorten the top line to:
# line above and below yield to the same answer
print( goodies[-1] )

#UC: below code replaces the first element(under index 0 )
goodies[0] = 'wealth'
print(goodies)

#WC: replace first element back with love
goodies[0] = 'love'
print(goodies)

#UC: code below will give you results between second and fifth element
print( goodies[1:4] )

#UC: from zero to fifth element
print( goodies[:4] )

#UC: from first to the last one
print( goodies[1:] )

#UC: code below adds element to an array
goodies.append("laughter")
print( goodies )

#WC: add resiliance to our array
goodies.append("resiliance")

#UC:
print( goodies )

#UC: code below removes last element
goodies.pop()
print(goodies)

#UC: removes third element (under index 2)
goodies.pop(2)
print(goodies)

#WC: create an array "moreGoodies" with elements: travel, company
moreGoodies = ['travel', 'company']

#UC: code below combines two arrays
print(goodies+moreGoodies)
